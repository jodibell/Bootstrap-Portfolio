                <p>As you can see I have a beautiful dog named Oliver who is far superior to most other canines, and humans for that matter. He works alongside me pretty much everyday running a digital publishing company. My husband and I co-own  and operate several different websites with differet user bases that are monetized in a number of ways. We like what we do because it gives us flexibility, mostly for traveling. Except Oliver doesn't really like flying on planes, so he limits his travels to Georgia and Florida for the most part.</p>
                <p>Before Oliver came along I led an interesting life that has only gotten better with him in it. I received a bachelors and masters degree from Georgia Tech in Architecture, back when we were ranked in the top 10 for Architecture schools in the country. Right out of school I worked for a modern Italian interiors company before embarking on my career as a serial entrepreneur.</p>

                <p>Through the years I've done residential renovations, had a design/build company, ran a real estate development company that built a 36,000sf mixed-use development in  Athens, GA from the ground-up, just in time for the real estate market crash of 2009....so I had to rebuild.</p>
                <p>Since then I've only completed renovations or architectural design work for myself or close friends. Instead I opened and sold a med spa in Atlanta, and now I co-own a regionally operated fence company as well as a digital publishing company. </p>
                <p>I'm a member of Entreprenuer's Organization in Atlanta's highest grossing forum. I serve as Secretary/Treasurer for the Franklin County (FL) Humane  Society. I will soon be involved with the board of the Doug Allen Institute at Georgia Tech as soon as this bootcamp is over.</p>
                <p>I enjoy exercising, and because of my limited free time with this bootcamp I've started running. At the beginning of this year I decided to start running 20 miles every week. Currently my goal has shifted to running 4 15K's in 4 weeks (as of this writing, 2 down and 2 to go). My beloved and supportive (and, at times, attention deprived) husband, and Oliver, are really proud of me.</p>
